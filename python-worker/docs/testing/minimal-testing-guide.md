## üöÄ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Create Test Data in Shopify

1. **Create Products**

   - Go to Products ‚Üí Add product
   - Create each product with the specifications above
   - Ensure all products are published and active

2. **Create Collections**

   - Go to Products ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí Create collection
   - Add products to collections as specified
   - Ensure collections are published

3. **Create Customers**

   # Check the logs for processing status
   tail -f python-worker/logs/app.log
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Results

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_data;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collection_data;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_data;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_data;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM line_item_data;

   -- Verify feature computation
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_features;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_features;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collection_features;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_pair_features;
   ```

2. **Expected Counts**
   - `product_data`: 5 records
   - `collection_data`: 2 records
   - `customer_data`: 3 records

from app.core.database.session import get_session_context
from app.core.database.models import ProductData, CustomerData, OrderData
with get_session_context() as session:
    print(f'Products: {session.query(ProductData).count()}')
    print(f'Customers: {session.query(CustomerData).count()}')
    print(f'Orders: {session.query(OrderData).count()}')
"

# Check feature computation status
python -c "
from app.core.database.session import get_session_context
from app.core.database.models import ProductFeatures, UserFeatures, CollectionFeatures
with get_session_context() as session:
    print(f'Product Features: {session.query(ProductFeatures).count()}')
    print(f'User Features: {session.query(UserFeatures).count()}')
    print(f'Collection Features: {session.query(CollectionFeatures).count()}')
"
```
